## The DROP TABLE Statement

The `DROP TABLE` statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.

**Note:** Be careful before dropping a table. Deleting a table will result in loss of all information stored in the table!

The following SQL statement drops the existing table `cars`:

### Example

Delete the `cars` table:
```sql
DROP TABLE cars;
```

### Result
```sql
DROP TABLE
```

---

## Display Table

To check the result we can display the table with this SQL statement:

### Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM cars;
```

Which will result in an error, because the `cars` table no longer exists:

### Result
```sql
ERROR: relation "cars" does not exist  
LINE 1: SELECT * FROM cars;  
                      ^
```
