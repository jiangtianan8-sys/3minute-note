## Sort Data

The `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result in ascending or descending order.

The `ORDER BY` keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the `DESC` keyword.

### Example

Sort the table by price:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products  
ORDER BY price;
```

---

## DESC

The `ORDER BY` keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the `DESC` keyword.

### Example

Sort the table by price, in descending order:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products  
ORDER BY price DESC;
```

---

## Sort Alphabetically

For string values the `ORDER BY` keyword will order alphabetically:

### Example

Sort the table by product name:

SELECT * FROM products  
ORDER BY product_name;

---

## Alphabetically DESC

To sort the table reverse alphabetically, use the `DESC` keyword:

### Example

Sort the table by product name, in descending order:

SELECT * FROM products  
ORDER BY product_name DESC;
