## Operators in the WHERE clause

We can operate with different operators in the `WHERE` clause:

|           |                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `=`       | Equal to                                                         |
| `<`       | Less than                                                        |
| `>`       | Greater than                                                     |
| `<=`      | Less than or equal to                                            |
| `>=`      | Greater than or equal to                                         |
| `<>`      | Not equal to                                                     |
| `!=`      | Not equal to                                                     |
| `LIKE`    | Check if a value matches a pattern (case sensitive)              |
| `ILIKE`   | Check if a value matches a pattern (case insensitive)            |
| `AND`     | Logical AND                                                      |
| `OR`      | Logical OR                                                       |
| `IN`      | Check if a value is between a range of values                    |
| `BETWEEN` | Check if a value is between a range of values                    |
| `IS NULL` | Check if a value is NULL                                         |
| `NOT`     | Makes a negative result e.g. `NOT LIKE`, `NOT IN`, `NOT BETWEEN` |

---

## Equal To

The `=` operator is used when you want to return all records where a column is equal to a specified value:

### Example

Return all records where the brand is 'Volvo':
```sql
SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE brand = 'Volvo';
```

---

## Less Than

The `<` operator is used when you want to return all records where a column is less than a specified value.

### Example

Return all records where the year is less than 1975:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE year < 1975;

---

## Greater Than

The `>` operator is used when you want to return all records where a columns is greater than a specified value.

### Example

Return all records where the year is greater than 1975:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE year > 1975;

---

## Less Than or Equal To

The `<=` operator is used when you want to return all records where a column is less than, or equal to, a specified value.

### Example

Return all records where the year is less than or equal to 1975:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE year <= 1975;

---

## Greater Than or Equal to

The `>=` operator is used when you want to return all records where a columns is greater than, or equal to, a specified value.

### Example

Return all records where the year is greater than or equal 1975:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE year >= 1975;

---

## Not Equal To

The `<>` operator is used when you want to return all records where a column is NOT equal to a specified value:

### Example

Return all records where the brand is NOT 'Volvo':

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE brand <> 'Volvo';

You will get the same result with the `!=` operator:

### Example

Return all records where the brand is NOT 'Volvo':

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE brand != 'Volvo';

---

## LIKE

The `LIKE` operator is used when you want to return all records where a column is equal to a specified pattern.

The pattern can be an absolute value like 'Volvo', or with a wildcard that has a special meaning.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

- The percent sign `%`, represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
- The underscore sign `_`, represents one single character.

### Example

Return all records where the model STARTS with a capital 'M':

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE model LIKE 'M%';

The `LIKE` operator is case sensitive.

---

## ILIKE

Same as the `LIKE` operator, but `ILIKE` is case insensitive.

### Example

Return all records where the model start with a 'm':

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE model ILIKE 'm%';

---

## AND

The logical `AND` operator is used when you want to check more that one condition:

### Example

Return all records where the brand is 'Volvo' and the year is 1968:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE brand = 'Volvo' AND year = 1968;

---

## OR

The logical `OR` operator is used when you can accept that only one of many conditions is true:

### Example

Return all records where the brand is 'Volvo' OR the year is 1975:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE brand = 'Volvo' OR year = 1975;

---

## IN

The `IN` operator is used when a column's value matches any of the values in a list:

### Example

Return all records where the brand is present in this list: ('Volvo', 'Mercedes', 'Ford'):

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE brand IN ('Volvo', 'Mercedes', 'Ford');

---

## BETWEEN

The `BETWEEN` operator is used to check if a column's value is between a specified range of values:

### Example

Return all records where the year is between 1970 and 1980:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1980;

The `BETWEEN` operator includes the `_from_` and `_to_` values, meaning that in the above example, the result would include cars made in 1970 and 1980 as well.

---

## IS NULL

The `IS NULL` operator is used to check if a column's value is NULL:

### Example

Return all records where the model is NULL:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE model IS NULL;

---

## NOT

The `NOT` operator can be used together with `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, and `NULL` operators to reverse the truth of the operator.

### Example: NOT LIKE

Return all records where the brand does NOT start with a capital 'B' (case sensitive):

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE brand NOT LIKE 'B%';

### Example: NOT ILIKE

Return all records where the brand does NOT start with a 'b' (case insensitive):

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE brand NOT ILIKE 'b%';

### Example: NOT IN

Return all records where the brand is NOT present in this list: ('Volvo', 'Mercedes', 'Ford'):

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE brand NOT IN ('Volvo', 'Mercedes', 'Ford');

### Example: NOT BETWEEN

Return all records where the year is NOT between 1970 and 1980:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE year NOT BETWEEN 1970 AND 1980;

The `NOT BETWEEN` operator excludes the `_from_` and `_to_` values, meaning that in the above example, the result would not include cars made in 1970 and 1980.

### Example: IS NOT NULL

Return all records where the model is NOT null:

SELECT * FROM cars  
WHERE model IS NOT NULL;

The `cars` table has no columns with NULL values, so the example above will return all 4 rows.
