## Aliases

SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

An alias only exists for the duration of that query.

An alias is created with the `AS` keyword.

### Example

Using aliases for columns:
```sql
SELECT customer_id AS id  
FROM customers;
```

---

## AS is Optional

Actually, you can skip the `AS` keyword and get the same result:

### Example

Same result without `AS`:
```sql
SELECT customer_id id  
FROM customers;
```

---

## Concatenate Columns

The `AS` keyword is often used when two or more fields are concatenated into one.

To concatenate two fields use `||`.

### Example

Concatenate two fields and call them `product`:
```sql
SELECT product_name || unit AS product  
FROM products;
```

**Note:** In the result of the example above we are missing a space between product_name and unit. To add a space when concatenating, use `|| ' ' ||`.

### Example

Concatenate, with space:
```sql
SELECT product_name || ' ' || unit AS product  
FROM products;
```

## Using Aliases With a Space Character

If you want your alias to contain one or more spaces, like "`My Great Products`", surround your alias with double quotes.

### Example

Surround your alias with double quotes:
```sql
SELECT product_name AS "My Great Products"  
FROM products;
```
