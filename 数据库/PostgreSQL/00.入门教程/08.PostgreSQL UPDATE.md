## The UPDATE Statement

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify the value(s) in existing records in a table.

### Example

Set the color of the Volvo to 'red':
```sql
UPDATE cars  
SET color = 'red'  
WHERE brand = 'Volvo';
```

### Result
```sql
UPDATE 1
```

Which means that `1` row was affected by the `UPDATE` statement.

**Note:** Be careful with the `WHERE` clause, in the example above ALL rows where brand = 'Volvo' gets updated.

## Display Table

To check the result we can display the table with this SQL statement:

### Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM cars;
```

## Warning! Remember WHERE

Be careful when updating records. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, ALL records will be updated!

### Example

Without the `WHERE` clause, ALL records will be updated:
```sql
UPDATE cars  
SET color = 'red';
```


### Result

UPDATE 4

Which means that all `4` row was affected by the `UPDATE` statement.
