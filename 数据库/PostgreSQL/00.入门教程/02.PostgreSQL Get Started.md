# Connect to the Database

If you have followed the steps from the[01.在macOS上安装&配置PostgreSQL](01.在macOS上安装&配置PostgreSQL.md) page, you now have a PostgreSQL database on you computer.

There are several ways to connect to the database, we will look at two ways in this tutorial:

- SQL Shell (psql)
- pgAdmin 4

Both of them comes with the installation of PostgreSQL

# SQL Shell (psql)

SQL Shell (psql) is a terminal based program where you can write and execute SQL syntax in the command-line terminal.

## Open SQL Shell (psql)

You will find the SQL Shell (psql) tool in the start menu under PostgreSQL:

**Tip:** If you cannot find it, try searching for "SQL Shell" on your computer.

Once the program is open, you should see a window like the one below.

Insert the name of the server.

The suggested choice is [localhost], which is correct, press [Enter] to accept:

# Database

The suggested database is [postgres], which is correct, press [Enter] to accept:

---

# Port

The suggested port is [5432], which is correct, at least in my case, press [Enter] to accept:

---

# Username

The suggested username is [postgres], which is correct, at least for me, press [Enter] to accept:

# Password

Enter the password you chose when you installed the PostgreSQL database, my password is 12345678:

# Result

The result might look like an error, but if it shows `psql (15.2)` or any other version, and in the end you see the `postgres=#` command (and maybe a warning in between), then you have successfully connected to the database!

# Execute SQL Statements

Once you have connected to the database, you can start executing SQL statements.

Our database is empty, so we cannot query any tables yet, but we can check the version with this SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT version();
```

To insert SQL statements in the SQL Shell command, just write them after the `postgres=#` command like this:

Press [Enter] and the result should look like this:

# Remember the Semicolon

**Note:** Always end SQL statements with a semicolon `;`

SQL Shell waits for the semicolon and executes all lines as one SQL statement.

A multiple lines SQL statement is not executed before we include a semicolon at the end.

## Example

Same statement, but in two lines:

Now we are ready to create tables and fill them with data, but first we want to take a look at an application called pgAdmin 4.
