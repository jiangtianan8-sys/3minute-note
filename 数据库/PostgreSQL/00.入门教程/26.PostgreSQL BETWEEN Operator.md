## BETWEEN

The `BETWEEN` operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

The `BETWEEN` operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included.

### Example

Select all products with a price between 10 and 15:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Products  
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 15;
```

---

## BETWEEN Text Values

The `BETWEEN` operator can also be used on text values.

The result returns all records that are _alphabetically_ between the specified values.

### Example

Select all products between 'Pavlova' and 'Tofu':
```sql
SELECT * FROM Products  
WHERE product_name BETWEEN 'Pavlova' AND 'Tofu';
```

If we add an `ORDER BY` clause to the example above, it will be a bit easier to read:

### Example

Same example as above, but we sort it by `product_name`:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Products  
WHERE product_name BETWEEN 'Pavlova' AND 'Tofu'  
ORDER BY product_name;
```

---

## BETWEEN Date Values

The `BETWEEN` operator can also be used on date values.

### Example

Select all orders between 12. of April 2023 and 5. of May 2023:
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders  
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-04-12' AND '2023-05-05';
```
