## Connect to the Database

To create a new database table using the SQL Shell, make sure you are connected to the database. If not, follow the steps in the [Get Started](https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/postgresql_getstarted.php) chapter of this tutorial.

Once you are connected, you are ready to write SQL statements!

## Create Table

The following SQL statement will create a table named `cars` in your PostgreSQL database:
```sql
CREATE TABLE cars (  
  brand VARCHAR(255),  
  model VARCHAR(255),  
  year INT  
);
```

When you execute the above statement, an empty table named cars will be created, and the SQL Shell application will return the following:

```sql
CREATE TABLE
```

In the SQL Shell application on your computer the operation above might look like this:

## SQL Statement Explained

The above SQL statement created an empty table with three fields: `brand`, `model`, and `year`.

When creating fields in a table we have to specify the data type of each field.

For `brand` and `model` we are expecting string values, and string values are specified with the `VARCHAR` keyword.

We also have to specify the number of characters allowed in a string field, and since we do not know exactly, we just set it to 255.

For `year` we are expecting integer values (numbers without decimals), and integer values are specified with the `INT` keyword.

## Display Table

You can "display" the empty table you just created with another SQL statement:
```sql
SELECT * FROM cars;

Which will give you this result:

 brand | model | year  
-------+-------+------  
(0 rows)
```


In the SQL Shell application on your computer the operation above might look like this:

In the next chapters we will learn how to insert data into a table, and also more on how to retrieve data from a table.
